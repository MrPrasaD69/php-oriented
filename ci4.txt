“Why CodeIgniter 4?”

Answer:
“CI4 is lightweight, fast, PSR-compliant, secure by default, and ideal for scalable APIs
and traditional MVC apps without the overhead of larger frameworks.”


Q. What is CodeIgniter 4?
Answer:
CodeIgniter 4 is a lightweight PHP MVC framework designed for high performance, security,
and modern PHP (7.4+) features. It follows PSR standards and uses Composer.

Filters (middleware)    ❌	            ✅
Entities	            ❌	            ✅


Q. What design pattern does CI4 follow?
Answer:
CodeIgniter 4 follows the MVC (Model–View–Controller) pattern.
Model → Business logic & database
View → Presentation
Controller → Handles request & response


Q. How do you create a controller in CI4?
php spark make:controller User

namespace App\Controllers;
class User extends BaseController {
    public function index() {
        return "Hello User";
    }
}


Q. How does routing work in CI4?
app/Config/Routes.php
$routes->get('users', 'User::index');
$routes->post('login', 'Auth::login');


Q. What is Auto Routing?
Answer:
Auto Routing maps URLs directly to controller/method names.


Q. How is Model different in CI4?
Answer:
CI4 models:

Extend CodeIgniter\Model
Use Query Builder
Support Entity classes
Have built-in validation

class UserModel extends Model {
    protected $table = 'users';
    protected $allowedFields = ['name', 'email'];
}


Q. What is $allowedFields?
Answer:
Prevents mass assignment vulnerability.
Only these fields can be inserted/updated.

Answer:
Entities represent single database rows as objects.
class UserEntity extends Entity {
    protected $dates = ['created_at'];
}


Q. What are Filters in CI4
Answer:
Filters act like middleware. Filters are request/response middleware. Before controller/After controller

Used for:
Authentication
Authorization
CORS
CSRF
Logging 

app/Config/Filters.php
class AuthFilter implements FilterInterface {
    public function before(RequestInterface $request) {
        if (! session()->get('logged_in')) {
            return redirect()->to('/login');
        }
    }
}

Q. What are Events?
Events allow code execution at specific framework lifecycle points.
Events::on('pre_system', function () {
    log_message('info', 'System starting...');
});
Common events:
pre_system,post_controller_constructor,post_system
Configured in: app/Config/Events.php
Filters for HTTP concerns, Events for application-wide behavior



Q. How does CI4 handle CSRF?
Answer:
Built-in CSRF protection using tokens.
$globals['before'] = ['csrf'];


Q. How does CI4 prevent SQL Injection?
Answer:
Query Builder
Prepared Statements
Automatic escaping
$db->table('users')->where('id', $id)->get();


Q. What is .env file in CI4?
Answer:
Used for environment-based configuration.
CI_ENVIRONMENT = development
database.default.hostname = localhost


Q. What is BaseController?
Answer:
A parent controller where you:
Load helpers
Initialize services
Share logic across controllers


Q. What are Helpers?
Answer:
Simple procedural functions.
Helpers are the group of functions that are useful in assisting the user to perform specific tasks.
There are three types of helper files. They are:
URL helpers: Used for creating the links.
Text helpers: Used for the formatting of text.
Cookies helpers: Used to read and manage cookies.

Q.What are hooks in CodeIgnitor?
Answer:
CodeIgniter’s hooks will provide a way to change the internal workings or framework functionalities without
any need for hacking the core files. It permits script execution with a particular path within the CodeIgniter

Q. What are Services in CI4?
Answer:
Services manage shared class instances (Singleton-like).
$session = \Config\Services::session();


Q. How does validation work?
Answer:
$rules = [
    'email' => 'required|valid_email'
];

if (! $this->validate($rules)) {
    return $this->validator->getErrors();
}
Supports:
Custom rules
Rule groups
Language-based messages


Q. Is CI4 REST-friendly?
Answer:
Yes. CI4 has:

ResourceController
RESTful routing
API Response Trait


Q. Why CI4 is faster than Laravel?

Answer:
No heavy ORM like Eloquent
Lightweight core
Minimal bootstrapping
“CI4 trades features for speed and simplicity.”


Q. How do you handle API responses?
return $this->response->setJSON([
    'status' => true,
    'data' => $users
]);

Q.Helper vs Library?
Helper** is a collection of common functions which we can use within Models, Views
as well as in Controllers. Once we include the helper file, we can get access to the functions.
It is not written in object-oriented format. It can be called in the same manner you call PHP functions.
All built-in helper file names are suffixed with a word _helper (ex: email_helper.php)

Library** is a class that has a set of functions that permits for creating aninstance of that class
by $this->load->library() function. It is written in an object-oriented format.
You must create an object of the class to call library functions by using the $this->library_name->method().
All built-in library files do not have a specific suffix.


Q.What are Drivers?
Answer:
Drivers in CodeIgniter 4 are a way to group multiple interchangeable implementations under a single
interface-like parent class. They allow you to switch functionality without changing the calling code.

A Driver is: A parent class, with multiple child driver classes that share the same API and are loaded dynamically
Think of drivers as:
“Different engines behind the same steering wheel.”
CI4 cache supports multiple drivers:File,Redis,Memcached,APCu


Q.What is used in Xampp - MySQL or MariaDB?
Answer:
XAMPP uses MariaDB, not Oracle MySQL.
MariaDB is a community-driven fork of MySQL, created by the original MySQL developers after Oracle acquired MySQL.
MariaDB is a drop-in replacement for MySQL
Same:SQL syntax,Ports,Data directories,PHP extensions (mysqli, pdo_mysql)
MySQL - InnoDB
MariaDB - InnoDB, Aria (crash-safe MyISAM replacement), ColumnStore (analytics), Spider (sharding)


Q.Can multiple Databases be used in CI4?
Answer:
Yes, CodeIgniter 4 supports multiple database connections simultaneously.
You can configure multiple databases and switch or use them together within the same application.

public $default = [
    'DSN'      => '',
    'hostname' => 'localhost',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '',
    'database' => 'main_db',
    'DBDriver' => 'MySQLi',
];
public $analytics = [
    'DSN'      => '',
    'hostname' => 'localhost',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '',
    'database' => 'analytics_db',
    'DBDriver' => 'MySQLi',
];

$db1 = \Config\Database::connect('default');
$db2 = \Config\Database::connect('analytics');


class UserModel extends Model {
    protected $table = 'users';
}
class ReportModel extends Model {
    protected $DBGroup = 'analytics';
    protected $table  = 'reports';
}

.env-
database.default.database = main_db
database.analytics.database = analytics_db


Q.What are Sessions?
Answer:
Maintaining user's state across the web by using Session. Default timeout of 24mins in PHP.

Sessions are stored in server files by default, can be stored in DB as well.
